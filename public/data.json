The company assumed it was at 'the council office' at Wokingham and switched that charger on remotely - eventually we realised that is a different location completely, which I drove to. If you don't have a 'card' don't go to this post - the company has no 'recird' of it - it is situated in a desolate carpark and is covered in cobwebs!!",
